# loan-status-prediction
This repository contains project materials for the Winter STAT 206 class, University of California, Riverside, A. Gary Anderson School of Management.

## Introduction
For those who are new to this folder, the `Project-Code.rmd`, `Project-Code.html`, and `Project-Code.Rproj` files are our main coding files. The data is originally obtained from Data.gov, link will be attached below. Feel free to explore more options beyond this analysis report.

### Project Idea
This project aims to develop a predictive model for loan status using a dataset containing various borrower attributes and loan details. By applying machine learning techniques, we strive to accurately predict whether a loan will be fully paid or defaulted. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. The insights gained from this project can help financial institutions assess loan applications more effectively, reducing the risk of defaults and improving overall decision-making in the lending process.
